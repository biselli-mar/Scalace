# Palace (Shithead) Card Game Rules

Palace, also known as Shithead, is a "beating type" card game that can be played by two or more players.

The objective of Palace is to be the first player to discard all of your cards by beating the top card on a *discard pile*.

## Setup:
1. Determine the _dealer_ and _first player_ by any agreed-upon method (such as drawing cards or age order).
   - A common method is to deal one card to each player, with the player receiving the highest card becoming the dealer and the player receiving the lowest card going first.
2. Shuffle a standard 52-card deck. For more than 3 players, use **two** decks shuffled together.
3. Deal **3 cards _face-down_** to each player. These are the base of players' "_palaces_".
4. Deal **6 more cards** to each player. Players can look at these cards and **choose 3** to add to their *palace*, placing them **_face-up_** on top of the face-down cards.
5. The _remaining 3_ cards form the player's **hand**. Players should keep their hand hidden from other players.
6. Place the remaining deck in the center of the table as the **draw pile**.
7. Either:
   - Turn the top card of the draw pile face-up next to it to start the **discard pile**.
   - Or, let the _first player_ play any card from their hand to start.

- `In a variation, the face-up cards in the palace are dealt seperately by the dealer, increasing the games difficulty.`

## Gameplay:
1. On their turn, a player can play **one or more** cards of **_identical rank_** from their hand onto the _discard pile_, following these rules:
   - The player must play a card of **equal or higher rank** than the top card of the **discard pile**. If they cannot, they must pick up the **entire** discard pile and add it to their hand.
   - Cards are ranked from _highest to lowest_: **2 to Ace**; with some rules including a "wrap-around" of the 3s being allowed to be placed on Aces.
2. _After playing_ cards, the player _draws cards_ from the **draw pile** to replenish their hand to **three** cards. (If you have more than three cards in your hand, you do not draw. If the draw pile is empty, you do not draw.)
3. Once the **draw pile** is **_empty_**, players continue playing cards from their **hand** until it is empty. If a player has no cards in their hand, they can begin playing the **_face-up_** cards in their **palace**.
   - Some rules allow players to _choose freely_ which face-up card to play from their palace
   - Other rules require playing the cards _in an order_ that **the player determines** once their hand is empty.
   - Cards of the **same rank** in the palace can be played in **one turn**.
   - If a player cannot play a face-up card, they must pick up the **entire** discard pile and add it to their hand.
4. Once the face-up cards in the palace are played, players can play the **_face-down_** cards in their palace. These cards are played **blind**, and the player must play them **immediately** when they are _turned over_.
   - If a player _cannot play_ a face-down card, they must pick up the **entire** discard pile and add it to their hand.
5. If a player _picks up_ the **discard pile**, they have to play their **hand** again, _before_ playing the cards in their palace.
6. Play continues until a player successfully **empties their palace**.


## Special Cards:
1. **2s**: 2s can be placed on **any card** and **_reset the discard pile_** to the value of the 2.
2. **10s**: 10s can be placed on **any card**. Once played, the **discard pile** is **_cleared_** and removed from the game, and the player of the 10 can play any card they wish to start a **new discard pile**.
   - If **4 cards of a kind** are played on top of each other, the _discard pile_ is **cleared**, as well.
- If you want to _increase the difficulty_, you can make it so that 10s _can **not**_ be played on **any card**.

### Special Card Variations:
1. **3s**: The 3 can be placed on **any card** and acts as a **_mirror_**, copying the value of the card _below it_.
2. **7s**: The 7 reverses **rank** order, meaning that you have to play a card of **_lower or equal_** rank to the 7.
3. **8s**: The 8 _reverses_ the direction of play.
4. **9s**: The 9 _skips_ the next player's turn.
5. **Jokers**: If playing with Jokers in your deck, they can be used as **wild cards** or as **Aces**.
